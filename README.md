# springpack-bullet

## Motivation
The main problem with toys like NERF guns and soft air, is that compared to real firearms, the energy driving the projectile is not contained within the (casing of) projectile, but rather has to be provided externaly. This leads to designs that are either too complicated and unreliable, like electric systems, or systems, that require a nontrivial amount of manipulation between each shot.

To address those shortcommings I designed a bullete, that consists of a casing, a powerpack and a bullet, that form a selfcontained, reusable cartridge.

## Function
The powerpack consists of two printerd parts and a spring. Those parts are designed in such a way, that the compressed spring can be stored between the lower part ("primer") and the upper part ("driver") forming the powerpack. When the powerpack is struck from behind by a firing pin, or a hammer and is moved upwards in the casing, special rails in the side of the case force the primer and the driver to separate, which releases the spring tension and propells the driver upwards inside the cartridge. Just at the end of the acceleration, the priver strikes the bullet, hence imparting it's momentum on it, and propelling it out of the casing.
